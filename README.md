# CT413

### What is in this repository?

This repository contains code used for my Final Year Project CT413. 
The primary purpose of this project was to develop a machine learning model to estimate sleep quality based on overall health, base demographics, and daily activity information. The project aimed to build a system where users can enter basic information about their health and activity, and where data is collected daily from sensors. The predictions generated from the model were analysed based on overall accuracy. The project also aimed to evaluate the model and investigate the potential for providing recommendations to individual users for behavioural changes that can be made to improve sleep quality.

Models trained were:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Neural Network

SHAP was used to analyse the performance of the neural network.

An app was developed using react native where users can upload their health and activity details, and receive a sleep quality prediction alongside recommendations for improving sleep.

### What is the purpose of this repository?

This repository will serve as a method of version control for my project, and will aid in tracking progress and task management for the programming elements of my project.
